# Basic React Projects

Here, I am creating some basic React Projects to implement what I have learnt in React to improve my coding skills in React.


## Birthday Reminder App
This is a very basic app where we can print data of the people from the data stored in a file locally.
In this App, I learnt how to get the data rfrom a file locally and display on the screen using components.

## Tours Remove Tour
This is an app where we can get the data from an API and then show the data in the form of blocks with tour images, places names, a short description about those places and prices to visit there.
In this App, I learnt how to get the data using API and display that in App, and also how to manipulate data (i.e. delete objects from the data came from API) inside the App.

## Review App
This is a basic app where we can see the reviews of the people by moving forward and backward by clicking on the previous and next button.
In this App, I learnt how to create a carousel in React.
